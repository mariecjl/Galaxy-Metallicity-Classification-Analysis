A collection of code used for the creation of plots, cutouts and analysis of the metallicity and other features of clumpy and nonclumpy galaxies. Primarily used on ESO's LEGA-C and SDSS's MaNGA data release. Primary libraries used includes AstroPy, Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy.

A sampling of functionalities/code includes:
- Creation of plots with features including:
  - Stellar formation rate and stellar mass
  - Gas dispersion, rotational velocity and kinetics 
  - Metallicity indicators (gas-phase metallicity, R23, O32)
- Cutouts of galaxies from JWST data releases, SDSS MaNGA
  - Webscraping cutouts and collage-creation
  - Image-based clumpiness classification
  - Confidence level evaluation
- Fitting metallicity curves
- Cross-matching LEGA-C and deconvolved catalogues
- Adjusting for dust extinction, filtering AGNs and outliers
